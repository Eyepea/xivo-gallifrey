PARSING LOGS
------------

* CRON way:

To parse the log at periodic intervals via a cronjob:

Inside the /parselog directory you will find a script to do
the job:  ./parselog.php
If you dont have binftm_misc installed you might need
to run 'php -q ./parselog.php'

If it works, add a cron script to run it periodically. 
Rotate logs if you want..

* REALTIME parsing

Realtime parsing is available in the commercial version.

FREEPBX (Trixbox, Elastix, etc) 
-------------------------------

If you run FreePBX, your agents will be LOCAL/blahblah
To let the parselog script change that, use the parameter
'convertlocal' like:

./parselog.php convertlocal

MAINTENANCE
-----------

If you want to clear/purgue the tables, run parselog.php with
the purge parameter:

./parselog.php purgue

Attention! It will remove all queue activity from the logs so you
can start afresh.
