This is Xivo, version 0.3

What is Xivo ?
==============

Xivo is an embedded Linux distribution for VoIP using the Asterisk Open
Source PBX. It can be configured through a user-friendly HTTP interface
for services like routing, firewalling, and of course, VoIP services.

This release is an alpha release. It may not work as expected and must
be considered work in progress. The HTTP interface is currently not
included and all configuration must be done using a CLI (you can
use SSH to log on the device - default root password: admin).

Building Xivo
=============

The build system is designed to support specific hardware. Distribution
specific properties are in dists/* files. Target specific properties are
in targets/* files. Architecture specific properties are in archs/* files.
For example, the /etc/fstab file is distribution specific. Targets are a
architecture/kernel/C Library combination, so uClibc configuration is
target specific. Architectures have only a few properties, like the
processor endianness. User configuration is in the config file.

To build xivo, you must set the $BASE variable in the config file to
a valid directory on which you have write access. The build system
prevents you from building as root, but at some points, it will
require root access (to be able to create the /dev/console character
device node), and will call sudo (I have not found a reliable solution
to this problem yet). Then, you must call the build.sh script with the
name of a distribution target (files in the dists/ directory). For
example, to build Xivo for the Xivo orange prototype (this hardware has
no reference :-)), run ./build.sh xivo. To build it using the GNU C Library
instead of uClibc, run ./build.sh xivo-i386.

The result of the build script is the creation of 3 images : sysboot.img,
sysroot.img, and sysconf.img. The first is an ext2 file system with the
Linux kernel and the boot loader configuration (currently, you must install
the boot loader manually). The second is a squashfs readonly file system which
will be used as the root file system. The third is an ext2 file system
containing configuration files, databases, and everything that needs to be
writable.

Installing Xivo
===============

The Xivo install process is currently entirely manual. You must partition
a Compact Flash disk (or anything else you want to boot from), and copy the
images to these partitions, then install and configure a boot loader such
as GRUB. Your partitions must match the /etc/fstab file specific to the
distribution you built. In addition, keep in mind that there are two
root partitions : when upgrading the firmware (the sysroot.img file), the
new firmware is written to the unused root partition, so that if the
upgrade process fails, the current firmware is unmodified. Usually,
sysboot.img is written to the first partition, sysroot.img to the second,
the third one is left empty, and sysconf.img is written to the fourth.

Roadmap
=======

Xivo 0.1 : Alpha release
Xivo 0.3 : Lots of bug fixes, package isolation, dependency
Xivo 0.3 : Inclusion of new packages, mainly mISDN and CAPI support
Xivo 1.0 : Stable release
