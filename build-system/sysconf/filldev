# mdev needs the presence of the root user and some gids in passwd and
# group. These files are located in /mnt, so they are not yet usable.
# As /etc/passwd and /etc/group are symlinks, and /etc is readonly, we
# must mount a temporary /mnt, with temporary passwd and group files, so
# that mdev can work correctly. Once /dev is filled, these files are no
# longer necessary (the temporary /mnt is unmounted by the loadmodules
# script).
