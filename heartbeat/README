INSTALL CLUES
=============

* install the python-pexpect (python2.3-pexpect) debian packages
* copy heartbeat    to /etc/init.d/heartbeat
* copy heartbeat.py to /usr/sbin/heartbeat.py
* update the following lines into /etc/asterisk/manager.conf
[general]
enabled = yes
port = 5038
bindaddr = 127.0.0.1
[heartbeat]
secret = heartbeat
read = command
write = command
* "reload manager" in the Asterisk CLI

The present directory is also shipped with cad_mmi.py, which is a trivial UDP
client that can be used in order to test the heartbeat server. Its usage is
	cad_mmi.py <host>



FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
======================

* heartbeat.py is a daemon started or stopped by /etc/init.d/heartbeat (start|stop)
* The /etc/init.d/heartbeat script launches heartbeat.py with no command line
  option, however the following options are available :
	-d      : avoids the daemon mode + gives some debugging output
	[-t|-l] : in order to test the UDP socket, doesn't connect to Asterisk but
			(-t) sends random status numbers
			(-l) loops endlessly from channel 1 Up to channel 30 Up
* The heartbeat.py daemon listens on an UDP socket on the port 5050.
  Upon the reception of a frame on this port, the daemon connects to the AMI
	port (5038) of the local Asterisk process, and fetches the channels'
	statuses, especially the Zap ones.
  The status 0/1 of the Zap channels is then aggregated into a 64bit pattern.
  The 32+2 MSB are reserved for future use.
  Then, if (let's say) only the Zap/15-1 channel is up, the UDP frame replied
	by the heartbeat.py server will be :

	# tcpdump -i lo -n -s 1500 -X port 5049 or port 5050
	09:48:20.400579 IP 127.0.0.1.5050 > 127.0.0.1.34059: UDP, length: 8
	        0x0000:  4500 0024 004a 4000 4011 3c7d 7f00 0001  E..$.J@.@.<}....
	        0x0010:  7f00 0001 13ba 850b 0010 fe23 0000 0000  ...........#....
	        0x0020:  0000 4000                                ..@.



MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION
=========================

* python-pexpect functions are used in order to chat with Asterisk AMI
* Parsing the results given by "show channels concise" is done whether some
  delimiters like ':' '/' '-' are present.
  As for now, only the Zap case is handled.



TODO
====

* improving casual robustness issues
* replacing pexpect/spawn with python/Telnet functions ?
