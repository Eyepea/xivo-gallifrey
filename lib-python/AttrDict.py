"""Dictionary wrapper that exposes an attribute interface

Copyright (C) 2007, Proformatique

Simply assigning __dict__ won't work because Python internally access the
base __builtin__.dict instance, so if this approach was chosen any behavioral
differences from __builtin__.dict would be masked. So the Python mapping to be
used is just stored in a special attribute.

Some additional attributes whose name start with '_attr' and that are not
related to generic attribute manipulation are used to provides specific
functionalities.

Other attributes starting by '_' are handled in a special way: first the
initial '_' is stripped, then the resulting attribute name is used to directly
access the one of the underlying dictionary. This approach has been chosen
because:

a) disabling the attribute/mapping bijection for this additional class of keys
doesn't really matters, as keys that are not string or contain special
characters or begin with a digit are already not directly usable as attribute
name anyway, and symbols starting with a '_' are reserved in lots of contexts

b) it would highly reduce the very interest of AttrDict to only be able to
access standard dictionary methods by directly dereferencing to the underlying
dictionary each time this is needed, as the goal is to simplify the notation
used when manipulating medium to deep trees when node names are statically
known in advance
