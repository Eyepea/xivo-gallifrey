class MountTree(NodeInst):
	
	"""A Resource Tree on which one can dynamically mount other Resource
	Trees. Because of the inherently dynamic behavior of this concept and
	in contrast to Node, SetTree and DynTree, management of subtree lookup
	will be performed by an instance of this class -- not the class itself.
	
	The behavior of the mount() and umount() methods is very similar to
	the one of the Unix mount/umount concept, except you don't have to
	pre-create mount points: for example if you mount something on
	('configuration', 'ethernet') in a previously empty MountTree instance,
	both 'configuration' and 'ethernet' internal nodes would be
	automatically created. When later you umount it, 'ethernet' will be
	automatically destroyed and if it has no sibling remaining (that could
	have been created meanwhile) 'configuration' will also be automatically
	removed.
	
	It is possible to mount something on the subpath B of a path A if
	something is already mounted on A, but it is not possible to mount
	something on A after B. This choice has been made because the internal
	data structures and algorithm used would make it difficult that the
	new A mount mask what was previously on B during the lifespan of the
	new A mount. In consequence, rather than exposing a behavior to
	different from the one of Unix mounts, this use case has been
	explicitely disabled. Ex:
	  - The following sequence is allowed
		rt.mount(('configuration'), subrt_a)
		rt.mount(('configuration', 'ethernet'), subrt_b)
	  - The following sequence is forbidden (an exception will be raised
	    during the second call and the state of rt won't change)
		rt.mount(('configuration', 'ethernet'), subrt_b)
		rt.mount(('configuration'), subrt_a)
	
	You can't unmount something that has childs mounted on subpaths:
	  - Allowed:
		rt.mount(('configuration'), subrt_a)
		rt.mount(('configuration', 'ethernet'), subrt_b)
		rt.umount(('configuration', 'ethernet'), subrt_b)
		rt.umount(('configuration'), subrt_a)
	  - Disallowed:
		rt.mount(('configuration'), subrt_a)
		rt.mount(('configuration', 'ethernet'), subrt_b)
		rt.umount(('configuration'), subrt_a)
	
	If a resource tree T is mounted on A and has no mounted childs on a
	subpath of A, it is possible to mount an other resource tree S on A
	that will, during its lifespan, override the first one. Unmounting
	newest overriding mounts is required before unmounting previous ones.
	This rule does not overload the previous ones, both can be used at the
	same time and every constraints must apply:
	  - Allowed
		rt.mount(('configuration'), subrt_T)
		rt.mount(('configuration'), subrt_S)
		rt.mount(('configuration', 'ethernet'), subrt_b)
	  - Allowed
		rt.mount(('configuration'), subrt_T)
		rt.mount(('configuration'), subrt_S)
		rt.umount(('configuration'), subrt_S)
		rt.umount(('configuration'), subrt_T)
	  - Disallowed
		rt.mount(('configuration'), subrt_T)
		rt.mount(('configuration'), subrt_S)
		rt.umount(('configuration'), subrt_T)
