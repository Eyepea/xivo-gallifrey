- RWLock		simple implementation with timeouts, without promotion

	Highly inspired from
		http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/502283
	which does promotion, and behave differently on timeouts / failures
	(raising exceptions)

	This code contains portions of the one linked above, which is :

- ListLock		simple dictionary used to atomically test and insert
			implemented locks are reentrant

	Useful to lock basing on dynamic symbolic identifiers instead of
	already known computer objects.

	Writers are always preferred by this implementation: if there are
	blocked threads waiting for a write lock, current readers may request
	more read locks (which they eventually should free, as they starve the
	waiting writers otherwise), but a new thread requesting a read lock
	will not be granted one, and block. This might mean starvation for
	readers if two writer threads interweave their calls to acquireWrite()
	without leaving a window only for readers.
	
	Maybe optimisations could be done by adding another condition to
	distinguish between waiting readers and waiting writers ?
