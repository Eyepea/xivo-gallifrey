    transmit within an URI...

    # happens when using an unicode charset: the conv parameter is
    # defaulted to the common dictionary MySQLdb.converters.conversions
    # when not explicitly given to the __init__() of
    # MySQLdb.connections.Connection, the _mysql module just store it in
    # the .converter member in the __init__() method of the base class
    # _mysql.connection, and later, back in the __init__() of
    # MySQLdb.connections.Connection, some children of .converter, which
    # are lists, are prepended by dynamically generated functions. The net
    # result is that every times a new Mysql connection is asked for with
    # no individualised conversion dictionary passed to the conv parameter,
    # a bunch of new functions and tuples are created, on which the process
    # will keep references forever, effectively leaking some memory as some
    # won't be used anymore after the termination of any connection.
    # This work around is believed to be effective because the only
    # references to the dynamically created conversion functions generated
    # by MySQLdb.connections will be in this instance-specific copy of
    # MySQLdb.converters.conversions. A unique reference to this copy will
    # be held by the connection instance, so when the latter is garbage
    # collected, the copied conversion dictionary is freed, and eventually
    # the now orphan tuples and generated functions are too.
