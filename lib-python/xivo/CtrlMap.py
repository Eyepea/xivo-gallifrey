# Python does not have a class hierarchy for its builtin objects so new style
# classes derivating from 'object' are not compatible with classes derivating
# from 'dict' (for ex.) when it comes to multiple inheritance
#
# This is an absolute mess for us because we can't add filtering capabilities
# by just derivating both our filtering class and underlying implementation
# class without knowing in advance if it's an old style class, a new one
# derivating from 'object', a new one derivating from 'dict', or even a new
# one derivating from <some_other_builtin_object> (would be curious but
# possible and even useful in some rare situations)
#
# So instead of using a derivating class based idiom, the implementation of
# CtrlMap will just keep a reference to an underlying object that presents
# a Python mapping interface.
#
# This has both advantages and disadvantages (Python implementation details
# that leaded us to that approach at the first time put aside), some of them
# follow:
#
# - Advantage: gives the possibility to get one supplementary indirection level
#   without the need of an other object just to do that.
#
# - Disadvantage: you might not want this supplementary indirection and
#   consider it as a risk in context where you would prefer your objects being
#   invariants BUT a fuse attribute can be added so that the object becomes
#   irreversibly invariant when the fuse is burned.
#
# - Disadvantage: The derivation based approach would have given us full speed
#   access to unfiltered methods, the underlying attribute one results in an
#   overhead all the time.
#
# - Disadvantage: probably also more memory consumption and reference counting
#   pressure.
