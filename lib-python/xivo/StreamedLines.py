def rxStreamedLines(fobjs=None, timeout=None, ctx=None):
    """
    rxStreamedLines() is a generator function that iterates over lines
    received on multiple Python unbuffered non-blocking selectable file
    objects - suitable to be used through the standard Python select
    module.

    A file object can be made non-blocking using the makeNonBlocking()
    function of this module.

    NOTE: under Unix, Python file objects wrapping pipes, sockets, ttys,
    and some char devices are acceptable if open as unbuffured then
    configured as non-blocking, while under Windows only sockets are
    allowed.  See the manual of the Python select module for more details.

    There are two ways to call this generator function:

    * for lines in rxStreamedLines(fobjs, timeout):
        print lines

     - fobjs is a sequence of Python unbuffured non-blocking selectable
      file objects.  You can pass None instead of a file object, in which
      case None will always be yielded in the corresponding iteration
      output.
     - timeout is an optional timeout in seconds; it is reset at each
      iteration and when new data arrives on any file descriptor (not
      necessarily a complete line - any data do reset it); it is suspended
      when the code flow is outside of the blocking code implementing this
      iterator; when it triggers, a Timeout exception is raised and the
      exception instance contains the abstract context that you can pass
      back by calling this generator function once again to transparently
      resume operations.

    * assert isinstance(x, RestartableException)
      resume_ctx = x.context()
      del x
      for lines in rxStreamedLines(ctx=resume_ctx):
        print lines

     In this second form, a RestartableException (which x is the instance
     of) has previously been raised by a previous iteration over an
     iterator generated by rxStreamedLines().  For now, the only
     RestartableException class is Timeout.  It is advised to drop every
     references to the exception instance as soon as possible to allow the
     Python context of the function which raised the exception (body of
     rxStreamedLines() ) to be freed.

    During iterations, tuples are yielded in which the nth element
    correspond to the nth element in fobjs.  Each element of yielded tuples
    is a string or None.  When it is a string, this is the next line
    available on the corresponding file object, and it usually contains a
    unique '\\n' which ends it.  Lines are yielded as soon as they are
    available, one at a time for a given file object.  There are two cases
    where a yielded string element does not contain a unique '\\n' that
    ends it:
     - if a stream is not terminated by a '\\n' as its last character
      (emitted by the peer before breaking the pipe or ending the socket
      connection, for example) then its last correponding yielded string
      will contain the last chunk of consecutive data received from the
      peer without any '\\n' in it;
     - when EOF is received on a stream, it is represented as soon as
      possible (in order with regular lines and last chunk for the same
      stream) as an empty string element of the yielded tuple (only once).
    When an element of the yielded tuple is None, this can mean one of the
    following:
     - the corresponding element in the fobjs parameter is None;
     - an other element of the yielded tuple is a string, but nothing
      happened on the file object corresponding to the None (neither
      arrival of enough data to yield one complete line nor occurrence of
      EOF) in the period between the last event on it and the simultaneous
      or following event on a string's corresponding file object which was
      associated with the data conveyed in the yielded string element;
     - an EOF on the corresponding file object had previously been reported
      by yielding '' for this element.

    One can sequence the two call form in something like the following, for
    example:

    fobjs = (child1_stdout_pipe_read_side, child1_stderr_pipe_read_side)
    timeout = 42
    resume = None
    while fobjs or resume:
            try:
                    for lines in rxStreamedLines(fobjs, timeout, resume):

            except RestartableException, x:
                    handle_exceptional_condition(x)
                    fobjs, timeout, resume = None, None, x.context()
                    del x
            else:
