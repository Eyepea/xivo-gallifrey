    Parse a sequence of lines, each of which contains only a single variable

    @reslst is a list of (varname, value, rotl), one per line of @lineseq
    In each (varname, value, rotl) tuple:
        @varname and @value are either two strings or both None,
        @varname can not be an empty string,
        @varname is a variable name when it is a string,

        @rotl is a string which contains the "rest of the line" (right

            None).

    NOTE: This implementation is very limited.
    * It does not support any kind of substitution / expression; an exception
      is raised if one is detected.
    * Each statement is limited to a single physical line.  Line continuations
      are _not_ supported.  <newline> in single or double quoted strings are
      _not_ supported.
    * On each non blank/comment line, if anything other than a single variable
      assignement statement is detected, an exception is raised.
    * If on a single line quotes are not correctly balanced, an exception is
      raised.
    * Arrays are not supported.
    
    HOWEVER:
    * The form $'string' with backslash escape sequences _is_ supported.
    
    KNOWN INCOMPATIBILITIES:
    * In bash 3.1.17(1)-release (Debian Etch):
    $ echo -ne $'\c'abc | hd
    00000000  07 62 63                                          |.bc|
    
    'a' disappear for no real reason - and the absence of matching single quote
    is not detected.  Probably a tiny bug in bash - or the spec. is evil.
    
    This implementation will raise an exception if you try to parse something
    like $'\c'abc.  With something like $'\c''abc there will be a mismatch
    between bash and this implementation: bash thinks there are two single
    quoted parts and the second if unfinished, while this implementation thinks
    $'\c'' is the only single quoted part and abc is unquoted.
